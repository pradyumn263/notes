## Hashing

Hashing is an improvement over Direct Access Table. The idea is to use hash function that converts a given phone number or any other key to a smaller number and uses the small number as index in a table called hash table.

###### Hash Function

A function that converts a given big phone number to a small practical integer value. The mapped integer value is used as an index in hash table. In simple terms, a hash function maps a big number or string to a small integer that can be used as index in hash table.

A good hash function should have following properties:

1. Efficiently Computable
2. Should Uniformly Distribute Keys
